Susan needs a website to promote her book and blog.

## updates:  
Susan is happy with her previous blogging service on WordPress, so we have decided to continue host her site there. But this time with a newly purchased domain name in her full name. The main purpose of the site is for promoting her books and to inlcude a link to buy from Amazon. Additionally, Susan would like to blog regularly to interact with her audiences. The site should also include a link to her old wordpress blog.  

## services:
Customise theme for the site  
Bio and book photography
